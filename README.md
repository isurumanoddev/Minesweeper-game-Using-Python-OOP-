# Minesweeper-game-Using-Python-OOP-

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game built using Python and the Tkinter module. The objective of the game is to clear the board without detonating any mines.



# Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this game, you will need to have Python 3 and the Tkinter module installed on your computer. If you don't have Python 3, you can download it here. Tkinter should come pre-installed with Python 3.


# How to Play
Click on a tile to reveal it. If the tile is a mine, the game is over.

Right-click on a tile to flag it as a mine. This can help you keep track of which tiles you think are mines.

The number on each tile represents the number of mines in the surrounding tiles.

To quit the game, simply close the window.

# Controls
To reveal a tile, left-click on it.

To flag a tile as a mine, right-click on it.

To restart the game, click the "Restart" button.

# Design
The game has a simple, clean design that focuses on gameplay. The tiles are represented as colored squares, and the background is a plain white color. The score is displayed in the top left corner of the screen.

# Object-Oriented Programming
This implementation of Minesweeper uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with separate classes for the game board and individual tiles. This allows for greater flexibility and easier modification of the game.

# Credits
This game was built by isuru manod using the Tkinter module.
